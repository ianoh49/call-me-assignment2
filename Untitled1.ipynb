        "\n",
        "The linear regression model developed for predicting road accident severity can provide significant benefits, especially in underdeveloped countries. By analyzing key factors such as the number of vehicles, road surface conditions, weather, and lighting, the model can:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Preventive Insights\n",
        "The model helps identify situations that are more likely to result in severe accidents. For example, poor weather conditions combined with dark lighting significantly contribute to accident severity. Authorities can use this information to take preventive measures, such as closing roads or issuing alerts during adverse conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Urban Planning\n",
        "Road safety measures can be improved by analyzing accident data over time. This model could be used to highlight accident-prone areas where infrastructure improvements, like better lighting or road resurfacing, are necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Traffic Awareness Campaigns\n",
        "Understanding which factors contribute most to accidents can help tailor public awareness campaigns. For instance, drivers can be educated on the dangers of driving in foggy conditions or during night-time when roads are wet.\n",
        "\n",
        "By leveraging data, underdeveloped countries could better manage traffic safety resources, reducing the rate of severe accidents.\n"
